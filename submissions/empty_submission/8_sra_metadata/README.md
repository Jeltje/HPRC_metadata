# SRA metadata

Once SRA accepts the submission it creates a link 'Download metadata file with SRA accessions' under My Submissions. This file contains the biosample and () and is named something like metadata-12876517-processed-ok.tsv.  
Rename it with the submission ID while keeping the SRA file ID (e.g. WUSTL_HPRC_HiFi_Year3_12876517.tsv) and put it in this directory.
