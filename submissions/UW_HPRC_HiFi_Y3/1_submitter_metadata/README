Note: We ran Primrose locally to create 5mc files, then uploaded those to the submission
under a separate 5mc directory. To make the submitter data match those new files, the
original tab separated file has been renamed to .txt. The tsv file contains the 5mc names.
It also contains file names instead of file paths.
This is the file that gets used by the merge code.
